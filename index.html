            The <b><i>Beagle</i></b> is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The
            <b><i>beagle</i></b> was
            developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking
            instincts, the <b><i>beagle</i></b> is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and
            foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The <b><i>beagle</i></b> is intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good
            temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
